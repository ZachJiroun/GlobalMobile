Nigeria, officially the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is a federal constitutional republic comprising 36 states and its Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The country is located in West Africa, with origins of the modern state of Nigeria coming from the British colonization of the region during the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries.

Nigeria is often referred to as the "the Giant of Africa", due to its large population and economy. With around 174 million inhabitants, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world. Nigeria is roughly divided in half between Christians, who mostly live in the Southern and central parts of the country, and Muslims, concentrated mostly in the North and South-West. In 2013, Nigeriaâ€™s economy (GDP) became the largest in Africa with more than $500 billion, overtaking South Africa becoming the world's 26th largest economy. The country's oil reserves have played a major role in its growing wealth and influence. Nigeria is considered to be an Emerging market by the World Bank, and is also listed among the "Next Eleven" economies to become among the biggest in the world.
