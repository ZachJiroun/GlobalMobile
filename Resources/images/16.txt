The Bahamas is an island country consisting of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean; north of Cuba and Hispaniola (the Dominican Republic and Haiti); northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands; southeast of the U.S. state of Florida and east of the Florida Keys. Its capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence. The designation of "Bahamas" can refer to either the country or the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the Royal Bahamas Defense Force, the Bahamas territory encompasses 470,000 km2 (180,000 sq. mi) of ocean space.

In terms of gross domestic product per capita, the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the Americas (following the United States and Canada). The Bahamas is a country that brings a lot of tourism. Their economy thrives due to the influx of travelers. Because this nation is very limited in resources, they get all their products from around the world. This causes an increase of trade and supports a world economy.
