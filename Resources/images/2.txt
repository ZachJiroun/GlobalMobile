Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north and northeast, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south. With over 93 million inhabitants, Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world, as well as the second-most populated nation on the African continent.

Some of the oldest evidence for modern humans is found in Ethiopia, which is widely considered the region from which Homo sapiens first set out for the Middle East and points beyond. Ethiopia is a multilingual society with around 80 ethnic groups, with the two largest being the Oromo and the Amhara. It is also the origin of the coffee bean. Ethiopia is a land of natural contrasts, containing vast fertile land, jungles, and numerous rivers, as well as Africa's largest continuous mountain ranges and the largest cave in Africa. Ethiopia's ancient Ge'ez script, also known as Ethiopic, is one of the oldest alphabets still in use in the world. The majority of the population is Christian and a third is Muslim, in addition to being the spiritual homeland of the Rastafari movement.
