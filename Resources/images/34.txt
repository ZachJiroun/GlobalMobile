Argentina is a federal republic located in southeastern South America. Covering most of the Southern Cone, it is bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north; Brazil to the northeast; Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east; Chile to the west and the Drake Passage to the south. Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America and the largest Spanish-speaking nation. Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.

Few events have highlighted the risks associated with globalization more dramatically than Argentina’s financial crisis in 2001. Throughout the 1990s, Argentina was considered globalization’s model of economic success. However, an unbalanced public fiscal budget, high foreign debt levels, and an uncompetitive currency level increasingly strained the economic system. The result was a dramatic loss of confidence in the Argentine peso, leading to bank deposit freezes, public debt default, widespread protests in the streets, and the resignations of the finance minister and the president.
