Algeria is a nation located in the Maghreb region of North Africa on the Mediterranean coast. It is the second largest nation in Africa after Sudan. The majority of the population lives along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This is because majority of the nation is part of the Sahara. Living on the coast allows for better trade, and a source of water that is easily accessible. Their economy is driven by petroleum and natural gas. These products are Algeria's main exports and their contribution to the international market. 

The Algerian riots in 1988 changed this nation as a whole. These riots allowed Algeria to take a Globalized approach to their political and economical structure. These riots eliminated the one party system and "democratized" the nation by adding a multi party system to the government. After reshaping the nation's government, the next step was to fix the economy. This was done by finding foreign investors to revive economic growth. The nation is currently on the incline with respects to GDP and political structure. Although it is a developing nation, their resources have allowed them to become a sustainable country with a good economy.
