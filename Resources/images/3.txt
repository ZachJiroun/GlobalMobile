Niger, officially the Republic of Niger, is a landlocked country in Western Africa. The country's predominantly Islamic population of 17 million is mostly clustered in the far south and west of the nation. Niger is a developing country, and is consistently one of the lowest-ranked in the United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI). It was ranked 186th out of 186 countries for 2012. Much of the non-desert portions of the country are threatened by periodic drought and desertification. The economy is concentrated around subsistence and some export agriculture clustered in the more fertile south, and the export of raw materials, especially uranium ore.

Nigerian society reflects a diversity drawn from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and regions and their relatively short period living in a single state. Historically, what is now Niger has been on the fringes of several large states. Since independence, Nigerians have lived under five constitutions and three periods of military rule. Following a military coup in 2010, Niger has become a democratic, multi-party state. A majority live in rural areas, and have little access to advanced education.
