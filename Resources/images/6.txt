South Africa is located at the southern tip of Africa. South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures, languages, and religions. Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution's recognition of 11 official languages, which is among the highest number of any country in the world.

South Africa is ranked as an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank, and is considered to be a newly industrialized country. Its economy is the largest and most developed in Africa, and the 28th-largest in the world. Although poverty and inequality remain widespread, with about a quarter of the population unemployed and living on less than $1.25 a day, South Africa has been identified as a middle power in international affairs, and maintains significant regional influence.
